- - [ ] Final maps.
- - [ ] Dialogue.
- - [ ] Sound effects.
- - [ ] Music.
- - - [x] Instrument voices. ...not overthinking this ;)
- - - [ ] Repair song end times -- last note must extend to the exact end.
- - - [x] What's in the box has tracks reversed. 0 should be bass and 1 lead
- - [ ] Tutorial 1: Playing With Toys
- - - [ ] Forbid using wrong items
- - - [ ] Static education about broom height limit, it's not obvious.

- By 7 January -- game jam submission
- - [ ] Guess gamepad mapping for unknown devices.
- - [ ] Toggle fullscreen.
- Stretch goals, or after submission
- - [ ] Clean up and improve minification.
- - - [ ] Maps could probably reduce to 5/8 if we switch to a binary format and base64 it. Would we benefit from RLE or some other very simple compression? Row filtering?
- - - [ ] Plenty of opportunity to eliminate whitespace in JS, inline constants, shorten private identifiers, etc. Or should we use an existing tool? They'll do it better.
- - - [ ] Eliminate unused space from the image.
- - - [x] Reformat songs so runtime doesn't need multiple tracks.
- - [ ] Touch input.
- - [ ] Some way to run without a browser. Electron, or build our own thing?
- - [ ] What would it take to generate a source map? Kind of painful looking up errors in index.html...
