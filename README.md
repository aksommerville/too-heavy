## TODO

- By 7 January -- game jam submission
- - [ ] Confirm it runs sanely with a high-frequency monitor. Ask Rick.
- - [ ] Enrich graphics.
- Stretch goals, or after submission
- - [x] More interesting song voices.
- - [x] Capture and playback of sound effects, rather than synthesizing from scratch each time.
- - - I'm not seeing any performance impact for the synth approach, no need to trade memory for it.
- - [x] Touch input.
- - - Scratch it; I'll never play on a phone, so it would not get maintained.
